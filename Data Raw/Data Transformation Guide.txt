Data Preprocess Steps:
Retrieve data from MTGMelee into an Excel workbook:
	Columns should be listed => Rank, Player, Deck, Record, List
	(The actual list of cards needs to manually copied into excel)

Save as CSV
Use Trifecta to fix the record formatting (split the record into wins and losses columns)

Create two flows in Trifecta:
	One ouput gives the aggrigated list without the deck
	The other is with the deck, formatted to clean the deck strings (remove the "")

Take the output with the deck and use DataPreProcessor.py to deconstruct the deck into the cards

Use the output file from the previous step in one final Trifecta flow, cleaning the strings for Tableau Visualizations
