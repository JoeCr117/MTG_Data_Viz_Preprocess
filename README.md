# Magic The Gathering Tournament Data Perprocessing Project

## By Joseph Crouson

The Objective is to take tournament results data from https://mtgmelee.com/ and the deck lists for each contestant
and preprocess the data for visualization in Tableau.

The data gathered is from any select tournament's 'Standings' section. The CSV's are hand stitched together in Microsoft Excel
(because the site does not give all contestants in one csv!) and an aditional column is added containing the card list for the deck.
Check the Data Raw folder for an example of the input.
